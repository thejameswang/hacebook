## Goal
The goal for this to create a frontend clone of Facebook using Ajax, JQuery, HTML, and CSS.
This is a personal project that explores the usage of APIs and server interaction. This version
will change to have a database.

### Disclaimer
  1. This is a frontend build clone of Facebook so that the functions work. The UI requires improvement
  2. This is a learning tool that taught me DOM manipulation, Frameworks, and different JavaScript essentials.
  3. There will be another version that incorporates the backend including MongoDB, Express, Node, and different packages
